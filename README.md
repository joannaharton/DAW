This is the code for the simulations run in "Combining Real-World and Randomized Control Trial Data Using Data-Adaptive Weighting via the On-Trial Score", currently on ArXiv (https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08756). "Harton_all_methods_RUN_SIMS.R" will run the simulations, "Harton_all_methods_PROCESS.R" will process the data into a more useable form, and "Harton_all_methods_OUTPUT.R" will plot the data as shown in the manuscript.
